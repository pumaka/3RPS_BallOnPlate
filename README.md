# 3RPS_BallOnPlate

## Cautions

This is a demo project. So there isn't a manual or description to help you with the process.

## Purpose

Basic platform for 3rps parallel manipulator, otherwise known as ball-on-plate. Which is a simpler version of [Stewart Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platform)

This project was made to reduce some of the tedious works that people have to face when carrying out the project.
Anyone is free to exploit this project as much as one might want. 

## Requirements

Arduino Mega board, FreeCAD program, revolutional-prismatic-spherical joints and etc.
17HS4023 stepper motor did not have enough torque to sustain the structure, so i would like to suggest ones with stronger torque, like MG996R.

enjoy!
